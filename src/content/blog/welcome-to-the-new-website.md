Welcome to the new look of my website! Excited to share this fresh design with you and hope you'll enjoy the improved experience. Months of searching and comparing from the Astro community and I believed it better reflects the goal of this website.

Goal with this design was to create a minimal design and great user experience. Streamlined navigation, enhanced visual elements and made it easier to find the information you need. Also focused on making the site more accessible, ensuring that everyone can enjoy our content regardless of their abilities.

I want to give credit to [Luca Ubiali](https://github.com/lukeska) for being a part of this. His deisgn looked awesome.

I hope you enjoy the new look and feel of my website. Please take a moment to explore.
