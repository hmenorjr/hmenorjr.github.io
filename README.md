# HMenorJr
## Freelance Platform & DevOps Engineering — designed for scale, reliability, and speed.
I'm *H*erman. A **Freelance Platform / DevOps Engineer and Consultant**. I help startups and growing teams design, build, and operate **scalable, secure, production-ready cloud platforms**. Available for **short-term consulting, fractional DevOps, and long-term engagements**.

## Services
I provide hands-on engineering and advisory services across the full infrastructure lifecycle:
- Cloud architecture design and implementation (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Kubernetes platform design, migration, and operations
- CI/CD pipeline design and optimization
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi)
- Reliability engineering (SRE), observability, and incident response
- Security hardening, IAM, and secrets management
- Cloud cost optimization (FinOps)
- Platform engineering and internal developer platforms (IDPs)

## Who I Work With
- Seed to Series C startups
- SaaS companies running production workloads
- Engineering teams scaling from MVP to multi-region
- Organizations modernizing legacy infrastructure

I collaborate closely with **engineering, product, and security teams** to deliver practical, maintainable solutions—not over-engineered systems.

## Technical Exposure
### Cloud Platforms
- AWS (EC2, EKS, RDS, IAM, VPC)
- GCP (GKE, Cloud Run, IAM)
- Azure (AKS, Networking)

### Containers & Orchestration
- Kubernetes · Docker · Helm
- Service meshes and ingress controllers

### Infrastructure as Code & GitOps
- Terraform · Pulumi · CloudFormation
- Argo CD · Flux
- Git-based workflows and change management

### CI/CD & Automation
- GitHub Actions · GitLab CI · Jenkins
- Secure build pipelines and deployment automation
- Artifact registries and versioning

### Observability & Reliability
- Prometheus · Grafana · OpenTelemetry
- Logging, metrics, and distributed tracing
- SLOs, SLIs, error budgets, and incident response

### Security & Compliance
- IAM and least-privilege access
- Secrets management (Vault, SSM, Secrets Manager)
- Secure supply chains and policy enforcement

## Engagement Outcomes
Recent consulting work has included:

- Designing Kubernetes platforms supporting **production workloads**
- Reducing deployment times by **X%** through CI/CD optimization
- Improving system availability to **99.9%+** using SLO-driven reliability practices
- Migrating legacy infrastructure to **Terraform-based IaC**
- Enabling self-service deployments through internal platforms
- Reducing cloud spend by **X%** via cost visibility and optimization

## How I Work

- **Outcome-driven** – focused on business impact, not just tooling
- **Automation-first** – eliminate manual and error-prone processes
- **Security by default** – built into pipelines and platforms
- **Documentation included** – clear runbooks and handover
- **Pragmatic solutions** – simple, scalable, and maintainable
